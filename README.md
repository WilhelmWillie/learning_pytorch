# Learning PyTorch

I'm behind in the game, it's time to get my hands dirty with machine learning, deep learning, and all the buzzwords. I took a small little online training session during my time at Salesforce and dabbled with NLP + PyTorch but want to get serious.

So hello world, welcome to my nitty gritty playground. I decided to open source and publicize my learning efforts for two reasons:

* Keep myself motivated. Having people keep track of my progress will help me do just that
* Be transparent about the learning curve. Coming from a mostly web development background, this is an entirely new field to me so I want to see how it is

So friends, hope you can join me on my journey. If you want, feel free to e-mail me wwillie@usc.edu tips and advice as I learn this complicated new field!
